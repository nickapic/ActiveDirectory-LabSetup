# ActiveDirectory-LabSetup
This is a report for setting up a small Active Directory focused lab at home and a few other machines sprinkled in the plan is to have it somewhat like a Hackthebox Pro Lab enviorment and this is a small documentation on how to set it up

The Plan is to add more vulnerable machines maybe and document how to set them up etc as well if you feel there can be improvements made please feel free to contribute
